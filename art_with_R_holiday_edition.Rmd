# Goals of document

1. Have fun
2. Try and make a pretty winter/holiday picture
3. Accidentally practice and learn some coding things

# Getting into it

## Packages

```{r}
# Delete this line after use!
# install.packages(c("svglite", "plotrix", "ambient"))
```

```{r message=FALSE}
# For saving plots to SVG
library(svglite)

# For easy plotting of shapes
library(plotrix)

# For use of "perlin noise"
library(ambient)
```

## Start by plotting some random

Let's start with a regular R plot. Plot `y` by `x`. Before we can plot `x` and `y` we need an `x` and a `y` to plot! Below makes some random data using the `runif()` function.

`runif` (short for "random uniform") pulls random values from a ["uniform" distribution](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/statistics-definitions/uniform-distribution/) (uniform here means that all values are equally likely, the prbability of each value is uniform).

```{r}
x <- runif(n = 32, min = -1, max = 11)
y <- runif(n = 32, min = 2, max = 11)
```

```{r}
plot(x, y)
```

## Modifying axes

It's snowing!!

Get them pesky axes out of there....

```{r}
par(pty = "s")
plot(
  x,
  y,
  asp = 1, # aspect ratio
  xlab = "", # no x axis label
  ylab = "", # no y axis label
  yaxt = "n",
  axes = FALSE, # turn off axes
  frame.plot = TRUE, # turn of the outline around the plot
)
```

Let's manually control the axes limits so that the snow isn't so close to the bottom of the frame.

```{r}
par(pty = "s")
plot(
  x,
  y,
  asp = 1,
  xlim = c(0, 10),
  ylim = c(0, 10),
  xlab = "", # no x axis label
  ylab = "", # no y axis label
  axes = FALSE, # turn off axes
  frame.plot = TRUE, # turn of the outline around the plot
)
```

## Draw a hill with math!

Let's add in some ground!  Flat ground is boring... what's a mathy way to make it look like we've got a hilltop?

Work on it by itself without the snow to mix things up.

$$y = -0.04 \cdot (x - 4)^2 + 2$$

* $\cdot$ -0.04 flips it and controls steepness
* -4 shifts it horizontally
* +2 shifts it vertically

```{r}
# don't modify `x`
x <- -1:11

# make a `y` using `x` to make our hilltop
y <- -0.04 * (x - 4)^2 + 2

# don't modify this plot code
par(pty = "s")
plot(x, y, asp = 1, type = "l", xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 10))
```

To combine this and our snow we can't use `plot()`.  We have two separate sets of `x`s & `y`s to draw and if we use `plot()` twice it will make two separate pictures.  We can use `lines()` to draw our hill after we use `plot()` to create our canvas and draw the snow.

```{r}
par(pty = "s")

x <- runif(32, 0, 10)
y <- runif(32, 3, 10)
plot(
  x,
  y,
  xlim = c(1, 9),
  ylim = c(0, 9),
  asp = 1,
  xlab = "", # no x axis label
  ylab = "", # no y axis label
  axes = FALSE, # turn off axes
  frame.plot = TRUE, # turn of the outline around the plot
)

x <- -1:11
y <- -0.04 * (x - 4)^2 + 2

lines(x, y)
```

## Snowflakes should be different sizes

What would make it look more like snow?...

Snow flakes shouldn't all be the same size. What's often beautiful about nature is the irregularities.

First lets just look at how to modify the size of the points.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*ðŸš¨ Pause ðŸš¨: we are professionals that can acknowledge homophones and push forward? ... right?*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `cex` parameter of `plot()` stands for "character expansion". It is how we can set the percent size of points or text in base R plots. By default it is set to 1 (100%) but if you want points twice as big set it to 2 (200%) and if you want points half as big set it to 0.5 (50%).

```{r}
par(pty = "s")

x <- runif(32, 0, 10)
y <- runif(32, 3, 10)

plot(x,
  y,
  cex = 0.4,
  asp = 1,
  xlim = c(0, 10),
  ylim = c(0, 10),
  xlab = "", # no x axis label
  ylab = "", # no y axis label
  axes = FALSE, # turn off axes
  frame.plot = TRUE, # turn of the outline around the plot
)
```

### Functions make your code better

Ok I've had enough of this ugly code we've copy pasted.  To re-use the code without it being so ugly we'll package it up into a function.

This function will take our `x`, `y`, `cex` and plot them just like we've been doing.  The addition I made was the use of `points()`, like `lines()` this lets us draw to an existing canvas rather than creating a new plot.

```{r}
plot_snow <- function(x, y, cex = 1, new_plot = TRUE, ...) {
  if (new_plot) {
    par(pty = "s")
    plot(
      x,
      y,
      asp = 1,
      cex = cex,
      xlim = c(0, 10),
      ylim = c(0, 10),
      xlab = "", # no x axis label
      ylab = "", # no y axis label
      axes = FALSE, # turn off axes
      frame.plot = TRUE, # turn of the outline around the plot
      ...
    )
  } else {
    points(x, y, cex = cex)
  }
}
```

Use the function to plot 2 different sizes of snow to the same picture.

```{r}
x <- runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 10)
y <- runif(n = 10, min = 4, max = 10)
plot_snow(x, y, cex = 0.8, new_plot = TRUE)

x <- runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 10)
y <- runif(n = 10, min = 4, max = 10)
plot_snow(x, y, cex = 0.3, new_plot = FALSE)
```

Ooooohhhhhh

### For loops can take advantage of functions

Do that for a bunch of different sizes!  To add randomness to the scene, we could vary the `n` in `runif()` for the different sizes.

```{r}

sizes <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.8)

new_plot <- TRUE
for (size in sizes) {
  x <- runif(n = 8, min = 0, max = 10)
  y <- runif(n = 8, min = 2, max = 10)
  plot_snow(x, y, cex = size, new_plot = new_plot)
  new_plot <- FALSE
}
```

Get our hilltop back in here!

```{r}
sizes <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1)

new_plot <- TRUE
for (size in sizes) {
  n_flakes <- round(runif(1, 3, 10))
  x <- runif(n = n_flakes, min = 0, max = 10)
  y <- runif(n = n_flakes, min = 3, max = 10)
  plot_snow(x, y, cex = size, new_plot = new_plot)
  new_plot <- FALSE
}

x <- -1:11
y <- -0.04 * (x - 4)^2 + 2

lines(x, y)
```

It needs something.... 

## Do you want to build a snowman?

<center>
<img src="https://i.giphy.com/media/WFJAqzg0hZ6dq/giphy.gif" width="50%"/>
</center>

Hear me out, I think it'll be nice to pretend we haven't made our beautimus landscape. Let's make a snow man and then when he's ready we'll place him on the hill top.

Building pieces separately is usually a solid move, and if we do it with some foresight we should be able to adjust the size and location in the landscape nicely and maybe give our snow dude some friends (or do [the back of SUV family stickers thing](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/0d/37/5c/0d375ceda1f9ae440eb738c1472a845f.jpg)).

### We need a blank canvas for our olaf

```{r}
# A helper to start a blank canvas
blank_canvas <- function(xlim = c(0, 10),
                         ylim = c(0, 10)) {
  par(pty = "s")
  plot(
    x = 1, y = 1,
    asp = 1, type = "n",
    xlim = xlim, ylim = ylim,
    xlab = "", ylab = "",
    axes = FALSE, frame.plot = TRUE
  )
}
blank_canvas()
```

### A snowman is just circles... right?

Corn cobs and buttons not included.

Circles have a center point and a radius.  We can use the `plotrix` package to draw some.

```{r}
blank_canvas(xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 10))
draw.circle(5, 5, 3)
```

```{r}
# These will be the only inputs
# the rest of the snowman will be based on these.
# This will allow for easier re-use on multiple snowmen.
base_r <- 2
base_x <- 5
base_y <- 2

blank_canvas(xlim = c(0, 10), ylim = c(0, 10))
draw.circle(base_x, base_y, base_r)

head_r <- base_r * 0.6
head_y <- base_y + base_r + head_r
draw.circle(base_x, head_y, head_r)
```

Functionalize!

```{r}
snowman <- function(base_r = 2, base_x = 5, base_y = 2) {
  draw.circle(base_x, base_y, base_r)

  head_r <- base_r * 0.6
  head_y <- base_y + base_r + head_r
  draw.circle(base_x, head_y, head_r)
}

blank_canvas()
snowman()

blank_canvas()
snowman(base_r = 3, base_x = 3, base_y = 2)
```

What's a couple more circles, add some eyes.

```{r}
snowman <- function(base_r = 2, base_x = 5, base_y = 2) {
  draw.circle(base_x, base_y, base_r)

  head_r <- base_r * 0.6
  head_y <- base_y + base_r + head_r
  draw.circle(base_x, head_y, head_r)

  eyes_dx <- head_r * 0.25
  eyes_y <- head_y + head_r * 0.2
  eyes_r <- head_r * 0.1

  draw.circle(base_x - eyes_dx, eyes_y, eyes_r)
  draw.circle(base_x + eyes_dx, eyes_y, eyes_r)
}

blank_canvas()
snowman()
```

Arms and then I'm done.

```{r}
snowman <- function(base_r = 2, base_x = 5, base_y = 2) {
  # tush
  draw.circle(base_x, base_y, base_r)

  # noggin
  head_r <- base_r * 0.6
  head_y <- base_y + base_r + head_r
  draw.circle(base_x, head_y, head_r)

  # peepers
  eyes_dx <- head_r * 0.25
  eyes_y <- head_y + head_r * 0.2
  eyes_r <- head_r * 0.1
  draw.circle(base_x - eyes_dx, eyes_y, eyes_r)
  draw.circle(base_x + eyes_dx, eyes_y, eyes_r)

  # guns
  arms_dx1 <- base_r * 0.8
  arms_dx2 <- base_r * 0.5
  arms_y1 <- base_y + base_r * 0.5
  arms_y2 <- base_y + base_r

  right_arm_xs <- c(base_x + arms_dx1, base_x + arms_dx1 + arms_dx2)
  left_arm_xs <- c(base_x - arms_dx1, base_x - arms_dx1 - arms_dx2)
  arm_ys <- c(arms_y1, arms_y2)
  lines(right_arm_xs, arm_ys)
  lines(left_arm_xs, arm_ys)
}

blank_canvas()
snowman()
```

## Snowmen on a hill

```{r}
sizes <- seq(from = 0.05, to = 0.5, by = 0.025)


new_plot <- TRUE
for (size in sizes) {
  n_flakes <- round(runif(1, 2, 4))
  x <- runif(n = n_flakes, min = -1, max = 11)
  y <- runif(n = n_flakes, min = 3, max = 11)
  plot_snow(x, y, cex = size, new_plot = new_plot)
  new_plot <- FALSE
}

x <- -1:11
y <- -0.04 * (x - 4)^2 + 2

lines(x, y)

snowman(base_r = 0.8, base_x = 2, base_y = 2.7)
snowman(base_r = 0.4, base_x = 3.7, base_y = 2.4)
```

# Additional ideas

```{r}

```

```{js echo=FALSE}
// add target="_blank" to links (makes em open in new tab)
(function() {
  var links = document.getElementsByTagName('a');
  for (var i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
    if (/^(https?:)?\/\//.test(links[i].getAttribute('href'))) {
